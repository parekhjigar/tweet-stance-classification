## Stance-classification

The stance classification problem is to develop a Deep learning model to classify tweets that are about one of five politically-charged targets: 

- Atheism
- The Feminist Movement
- Climate Change is a Real Concern
- Legalization of Abortion
- Hillary Clinton

Given the text of a tweet and a target, models must classify the stance as either:

- FAVOUR
- AGAINST
- NEITHER

## Dataset
