## stance-classification

The stance classification problem is to develop a Deep learning model to classify tweets that are about one of five politically-charged targets: “Atheism”, “the Feminist Movement”, “Climate Change is a Real Concern”, “Legalization of Abortion”, or “Hillary Clinton”. Given the text of a tweet and a target, models must classify the tweet as either FAVOUR or AGAINST, or NEITHER.
